# Sonar-Prediction

The main aim is to find the accuracy of the classification models for binary classification. The classification methods that were used here are : 
Logistic Regression,
Support Vector Machine(SVM),
KNearestNeighbors (KNN),
Decision Tree Classifier.


Particularly here I used all the solvers,kernels,splitters for respective models and compared the metrics inside each model.
